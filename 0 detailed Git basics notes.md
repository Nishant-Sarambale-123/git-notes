Got it 👍 Let’s build **detailed Git basics notes**, followed by **interview questions** and **scenario-based questions with answers**.

# 📘 Git Basics – Detailed Notes

### 1. **What is Git?**

* Git is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**.
* Unlike Centralized VCS (like SVN), Git allows every developer to have a **complete copy of the repository with full history** on their local machine.
* This makes development **faster, resilient, and offline-friendly**.

---

### 2. **Why Git? (Advantages)**

* **Distributed:** Every clone is a full backup of the repo.
* **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work simultaneously without overwriting each other’s code.
* **Branching & Merging:** Lightweight, fast, and flexible branching model.
* **Integrity:** Uses SHA-1 hashing to track changes, ensuring data integrity.
* **Staging Area:** Git provides an intermediate stage before committing, giving better control.

---

### 3. **Git Architecture**

* **Working Directory:** Actual files where you make changes.
* **Staging Area (Index):** Snapshot of changes you want to commit.
* **Local Repository:** Commits stored on your machine.
* **Remote Repository:** Shared repo (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) for collaboration.

Flow:

```
Working Directory → Staging Area → Local Repository → Remote Repository
```

---

### 4. **Key Git Concepts**

* **Commit:** A snapshot of your project at a point in time.
* **Branch:** A movable pointer to commits, used to isolate work.
* **Merge:** Combining work from different branches.
* **Rebase:** Reapplying commits on top of another base.
* **Clone:** Copy of remote repo with full history.
* **Pull:** Fetch + Merge changes from remote to local.
* **Push:** Upload local commits to remote.
* **Tag:** Named reference to specific commits (often used for releases).

---

### 5. **Git Workflow**

1. Make changes in the **working directory**.
2. Add them to **staging area** (`git add file`).
3. Commit the changes (`git commit -m "message"`).
4. Push commits to **remote repository** (`git push`).
5. Pull latest changes (`git pull`) when working with teams.

---

### 6. **Common Git Commands**

* `git init` → Initialize repo
* `git clone <url>` → Clone remote repo
* `git status` → Show changed files
* `git add <file>` / `git add .` → Stage changes
* `git commit -m "message"` → Commit staged changes
* `git log` → View commit history
* `git branch` → List branches
* `git checkout <branch>` → Switch branch
* `git merge <branch>` → Merge a branch into current
* `git pull` → Get changes from remote
* `git push` → Push local commits to remote

# 🎤 Git Interview Questions

### Basic Questions

1. **What is Git and why is it used?**
   → Git is a DVCS used for tracking changes in code, enabling collaboration and maintaining version history.

2. **Difference between Git and GitHub?**
   → Git = version control tool.
   → GitHub = hosting service for Git repositories.

3. **What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?**

   * `git fetch`: Downloads changes but does not merge.
   * `git pull`: Fetch + Merge automatically.

4. **What is a Git branch?**
   → A pointer to a commit, used for parallel development without affecting main code.

5. **Explain staging area in Git.**
   → Intermediate area where changes are reviewed before committing.

6. **How does Git ensure data integrity?**
   → Each commit is identified by a SHA-1 hash, ensuring uniqueness and integrity.

---

### Intermediate Questions

1. **Difference between merge and rebase?**

   * Merge → Creates a new merge commit, keeps history.
   * Rebase → Re-applies commits on another branch, creates linear history.

2. **What is Git HEAD?**
   → A pointer that represents the current branch reference.

3. **What are Git tags?**
   → Labels for commits, commonly used for release versions.

4. **How do you undo a commit?**

   * `git reset --soft <commit>` → Keep changes staged.
   * `git reset --hard <commit>` → Discard changes.
   * `git revert <commit>` → Creates a new commit that undoes changes.

---

### Advanced Questions

1. **Explain Git cherry-pick.**
   → Apply a specific commit from one branch onto another branch.

2. **How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?**
   → Conflicting files are marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`.
   → Manually edit, stage, and commit.

3. **What’s the difference between Git reset, revert, and checkout?**

   * Reset → Moves branch pointer (can discard commits).
   * Revert → Creates new commit to undo.
   * Checkout → Switch branches or restore files.

4. **How does Git handle branching internally?**
   → Branches are just lightweight pointers to commits (refs stored in `.git/refs/heads`).

# 📌 Scenario-Based Questions & Answers

### Scenario 1:

👉 You committed sensitive info (like a password) to Git. How do you fix it?
✅ Use `git rebase -i` or `git filter-branch` / `git filter-repo` to remove the commit and force-push.

---

### Scenario 2:

👉 You’re working in a team. Someone pushed changes to `main`, but you also made local commits. What do you do?
✅ Use `git pull --rebase origin main` to apply your commits on top of the latest remote.

---

### Scenario 3:

👉 You created a feature branch and want only a single commit from another branch without merging all.
✅ Use `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`.

---

### Scenario 4:

👉 You accidentally pushed to the wrong branch. How do you fix?
✅ Switch to correct branch, `git cherry-pick` the commit, then `git reset --hard` the wrong branch and force push.

---

### Scenario 5:

👉 How do you handle large files in Git?
✅ Use **Git LFS (Large File Storage)** to track large binary files.
