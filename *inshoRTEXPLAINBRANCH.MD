Hereâ€™s a **short and clear version** you can say in an **interview** ðŸ‘‡

**GitFlow Branching with CI/CD â€“ Short Explanation:**

> We follow the GitFlow model where development happens in multiple stages before production.
> Developers create **feature branches** from `develop` and push their code â€” this triggers CI to run unit tests and builds.
> Once merged into `develop`, the CI/CD pipeline deploys automatically to the **Test/QA environment** for integration testing.

When all features are stable, we create a **release branch** from `develop`.
This branch is used for **UAT and final testing** â€” CI/CD deploys it to the **Pre-Prod (staging)** environment.

After approval, the release is merged into `main`.
Merging to `main` triggers the final CI/CD pipeline that builds, tags, and **deploys to Production**.

If a critical issue occurs in production, a **hotfix branch** is created from `main`, fixed, tested, and redeployed quickly â€” then merged back to both `main` and `develop`.

âœ… **In short line:**

> Feature â†’ Develop (Test) â†’ Release (Pre-Prod) â†’ Main (Prod)
> CI/CD triggers build, test, and deploy at each stage.

Git Branching Flow â€“ Summary 
main branch (also called master or trunk)
â†’ Holds the stable, production-ready code. Always up-to-date.

Feature branch
â†’ Created from main to develop a new feature or a breaking change.
â†’ Developers collaborate here independently.
â†’ Example: feature/login-auth.

Merge
â†’ Once the feature is complete and tested, the feature branch is merged into main.
â†’ Optionally, the branch is deleted after merging to keep the repo clean.

Release branch
â†’ Created from main when preparing for a production release.
â†’ Used for final testing, bug fixes, and polishing before deployment.
â†’ Example: release/v1.0.

Ship/Deploy
â†’ Code from the release branch is deployed to production.
â†’ Release is tagged for versioning (e.g., v1.0.0).

Hotfix branch
â†’ Created directly from main when an urgent bug or critical issue occurs in production.
â†’ After the fix, it's merged into both main and release branches.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ~main â†’ feature â†’ merge to main â†’ release â†’ test â†’ ship
â†’ If urgent issue: main â†’ hotfix â†’ fix â†’ merge back to main and release
